                            showed their limits as their armor thickness, rivets and petrol engines tends make them easy prey for Japanese Ha-Gos 
                            and IJA tank-killer teams with Cocktail Molotov, Koshkin convinced Stalin to authorize further development and the "A-32" 
                            protoype was developed with its thicker armor, Christie suspension and a 76.2mm gun. During tests at Kubinka, despite the 
                            increased armor it kept the same mobility as its forerunner so it was favored over the A-20. In 1940 they increased its armor 
                            even more, fitting with wider tracks and a new 76.2m L-11 gun, the new "T-34 Model 1940" was born. With about 400 models of 
                            this variant were made the production quickly switched to the "Model 1941" equipped with the new 76.2mm F-34 gun and new radios. 
                            In 1942 appeared the "Model 1942" that featured thicker armor protection and minor manufacturing improvements such as new tracks, 
                            wheel patterns or driver hatch. The "Model 1943" make its appearance in May 1942 featured a new hexagonal turret (cast or pressed 
                            depending on the factories), a little more armour, more storage for ammunition and more fuel. </p>
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Following the appearance of the long-barreled Panzer IV, the Tiger or the Panther, a new Soviet project destined 
                             to replace the T-34 and the KV-1 begun, the T-43. It featured a three-man turret, a heavier armor and torsion-bar suspensions, 
                             however because of the prototype was still vulnerable to German 88m guns, has its mobililty reduced by its armor and its manufacturing 
                             would have slow-down production the project was abandoned. However its turret design was used to be fitted with a 85mm gun 
                             (as the 76.2mm gun was unable to penetrate the Tiger's armor), so the T-34's chassis turret ring was enlarged to be fitted 
                             with the bigger turret, it became the T-34-85. The "Model 1943" with the 85mm D-5T gun was produced from January to March 
                             1944, quickly followed by the "Model 1944" with the much simpler 85mm ZiS-S-53 gun from March to the end of 1944 and then 
                             by the "Model 1945" which featured a electrically powered turret traverse motor. </p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Its design allowed it to be continuously refined to meet the constantly evolving needs of the Eastern Front:
                            while the war went on it became more capable, but also quicker and cheaper to produce. Soviet industry would eventually 
                            produce over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded while the war progressed despite 
                            the loss of tens of thousands of them in combat against the German Wehrmacht. Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service,
                            it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/55 series). 
                            At 44,900 losses during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses of all time. Its development led directly to the T-54 and T-55
                            series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, T-72, and T-90 that form the armoured core of many modern armies. T-34 variants 
                            were widely exported after World War II, and even as recently as 2010, the tank has seen limited front-line service with several developing countries.</p>
                              
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">An unknown number were fitted with a high-velocity 57mm ZiS-4 L/73 to be used as tank destroyers, this variant 
                             was called <a class="text" href="http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/soviet/t34exterminator" target="_blank">T-34-57</a>
                             , ten of them participate at the Battle of Moscow in late 1941 where they were all destroyed not without inflicting 
                             tremendous damage to the enemy, the concept was revisited in 1943 but was dropped in favor of the T-34-85. Some were also equipped 
                             with a flame-thrower unit replacing the hull machine-gun, they were called OT-34 and OT-34-85. Finally the T-34's chassis was used 
                             to build tank destroyers SU-85 and SU-100 and self-propelled howitzers SU-122.</p>

                           <p class="bodyTextT">While it had been authorized for production, the T-34 was subjected to political pressure, essentially
                            coming from Kliment Voroshilov its main competitor and some conservative elements of the Army, 
                            to end its production and redirect ressources to the T-26, BT-tanks or the KV-1.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">At the start of the hostilities, the T-34 was proved to be a very unpleasant 
                            surprise for Germans as it was superior to any tanks they had in service and their main AT gun 
                            was ineffective against its armor, only 88mm AA gun and 105mm howitzers can harm them. Despite 
                            this in 1941 approximately 2300 T-34 were lost due to German tactical skills and mechanical breakdowns, 
                            also the poor leadership in tank tactics and lack of crew training, essentially coming from the 1937's 
                            Stalin's purges, reduced the army's efficiency and morale. All these factors negated the T-34's strategic 
                            value.</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">In 1942, the T-34 saw many improvements and play an essential role during the German Summer Offensive (Fall Blau), 
                            during the Battle of Stalingrad in December 1942 by performing a double encirclement manoeuver that cut off the German Sixth Army and 
                            take part to the last German major offensive during the Battle of Kursk in July. However in late 1942 and July 1943 the T-34 saw two 
                            new contenders appears, more armored and better armed, in the person of the Tiger I and the Panther. Both practically impervious to 
                            the 76.2mm gun and able to destroy the T-34 far outside its effective range. In summer 1943 the T-34 was judged outmatched by new German 
                            tanks, its evolution the T-34-85 was produced from January 1944 to the end of war. While its new 85mm was still not enough to match the 
                            Tiger it was a major improvement and it participate to all major Soviets offensive until the Battle of Berlin. The T-34 also saw limited 
                            action in the Manchurian campaign on August 1945, where it didn't encounter many resistance. </p>

                              suffered heavy losses due to little training. Ten Czechoslovak T-34s saw action during the Battle of Kiev on November 1943 
                              where they performed very well with minimal losses. </p>
                                
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">Germany captured a large number of T-34s and use them under the designation Panzerkampfwagen T-34 747(r), they were 
                             fitted with cupolas and radio equipments. In July 1944 a single T-34 was converted into a self-propelled antiaircraft gun armed with 
                             a 2cm Flakvierling 38 in a new armored turret with an open top, it was named Flakpanzer T-34. </p>

                            Some are still in service in the 21st Century in several developing or third-world countries. Soviet Union eventually

                             of fast tanks. The T-26 was slow-moving, designed to keep pace with infantry on the ground. The BT tanks were 
                             cavalry tanks: fast-moving and light, designed for maneuver warfare. Both were Soviet developments of foreign 
                             designs from the early 1930s; the T-26 was based on the British Vickers 6-Ton, and the BT tanks were based on 
                             a design from American engineer J. Walter Christie.</p>

                            series or the T-26. It became the mainstay of the Red Army's Armored divisions.</p>

                            system, a new Diesel engine and sloped armor. After the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939, where Soviets fast tanks 
                            showed their limits as their armor thickness, rivets and petrol engines tends make them easy prey for Japanese Ha-Gos 
                            and IJA tank-killer teams with Cocktail Molotov, Koshkin convinced Stalin to authorize further development and the "A-32" 
                            protoype was developed with its thicker armor, Christie suspension and a 76.2mm gun. During tests at Kubinka, despite the 
                            increased armor it kept the same mobility as its forerunner so it was favored over the A-20. In 1940 they increased its armor 
                            even more, fitting with wider tracks and a new 76.2m L-11 gun, the new "T-34 Model 1940" was born. With about 400 models of 
                            this variant were made the production quickly switched to the "Model 1941" equipped with the new 76.2mm F-34 gun and new radios. 
                            In 1942 appeared the "Model 1942" that featured thicker armor protection and minor manufacturing improvements such as new tracks, 
                            wheel patterns or driver hatch. The "Model 1943" make its appearance in May 1942 featured a new hexagonal turret (cast or pressed 
                            depending on the factories), a little more armour, more storage for ammunition and more fuel. </p>
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Following the appearance of the long-barreled Panzer IV, the Tiger or the Panther, a new Soviet project destined 
                             to replace the T-34 and the KV-1 begun, the T-43. It featured a three-man turret, a heavier armor and torsion-bar suspensions, 
                             however because of the prototype was still vulnerable to German 88m guns, has its mobililty reduced by its armor and its manufacturing 
                             would have slow-down production the project was abandoned. However its turret design was used to be fitted with a 85mm gun 
                             (as the 76.2mm gun was unable to penetrate the Tiger's armor), so the T-34's chassis turret ring was enlarged to be fitted 
                             with the bigger turret, it became the T-34-85. The "Model 1943" with the 85mm D-5T gun was produced from January to March 
                             1944, quickly followed by the "Model 1944" with the much simpler 85mm ZiS-S-53 gun from March to the end of 1944 and then 
                             by the "Model 1945" which featured a electrically powered turret traverse motor. </p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Its design allowed it to be continuously refined to meet the constantly evolving needs of the Eastern Front:
                            while the war went on it became more capable, but also quicker and cheaper to produce. Soviet industry would eventually 
                            produce over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded while the war progressed despite 
                            the loss of tens of thousands of them in combat against the German Wehrmacht. Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service,
                            it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/55 series). 
                            At 44,900 losses during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses of all time. Its development led directly to the T-54 and T-55
                            series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, T-72, and T-90 that form the armoured core of many modern armies. T-34 variants 
                            were widely exported after World War II, and even as recently as 2010, the tank has seen limited front-line service with several developing countries.</p>
                              
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">An unknown number were fitted with a high-velocity 57mm ZiS-4 L/73 to be used as tank destroyers, this variant 
                             was called <a class="text" href="http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/soviet/t34exterminator" target="_blank">T-34-57</a>
                             , ten of them participate at the Battle of Moscow in late 1941 where they were all destroyed not without inflicting 
                             tremendous damage to the enemy, the concept was revisited in 1943 but was dropped in favor of the T-34-85. Some were also equipped 
                             with a flame-thrower unit replacing the hull machine-gun, they were called OT-34 and OT-34-85. Finally the T-34's chassis was used 
                             to build tank destroyers SU-85 and SU-100 and self-propelled howitzers SU-122.</p>

                           <p class="bodyTextT">While it had been authorized for production, the T-34 was subjected to political pressure, essentially
                            coming from Kliment Voroshilov its main competitor and some conservative elements of the Army, 
                            to end its production and redirect ressources to the T-26, BT-tanks or the KV-1.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">At the start of the hostilities, the T-34 was proved to be a very unpleasant 
                            surprise for Germans as it was superior to any tanks they had in service and their main AT gun 
                            was ineffective against its armor, only 88mm AA gun and 105mm howitzers can harm them. Despite 
                            this in 1941 approximately 2300 T-34 were lost due to German tactical skills and mechanical breakdowns, 
                            also the poor leadership in tank tactics and lack of crew training, essentially coming from the 1937's 
                            Stalin's purges, reduced the army's efficiency and morale. All these factors negated the T-34's strategic 
                            value.</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">In 1942, the T-34 saw many improvements and play an essential role during the German Summer Offensive (Fall Blau), 
                            during the Battle of Stalingrad in December 1942 by performing a double encirclement manoeuver that cut off the German Sixth Army and 
                            take part to the last German major offensive during the Battle of Kursk in July. However in late 1942 and July 1943 the T-34 saw two 
                            new contenders appears, more armored and better armed, in the person of the Tiger I and the Panther. Both practically impervious to 
                            the 76.2mm gun and able to destroy the T-34 far outside its effective range. In summer 1943 the T-34 was judged outmatched by new German 
                            tanks, its evolution the T-34-85 was produced from January 1944 to the end of war. While its new 85mm was still not enough to match the 
                            Tiger it was a major improvement and it participate to all major Soviets offensive until the Battle of Berlin. The T-34 also saw limited 
                            action in the Manchurian campaign on August 1945, where it didn't encounter many resistance. </p>
                              
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">In 1943 Polish and Czechoslovak armies-in-exile also received T-34 "Model 1943", like the Russians in 1941 they 
                              suffered heavy losses due to little training. Ten Czechoslovak T-34s saw action during the Battle of Kiev on November 1943 
                              where they performed very well with minimal losses. </p>
                                
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">Germany captured a large number of T-34s and use them under the designation Panzerkampfwagen T-34 747(r), they were 
                             fitted with cupolas and radio equipments. In July 1944 a single T-34 was converted into a self-propelled antiaircraft gun armed with 
                             a 2cm Flakvierling 38 in a new armored turret with an open top, it was named Flakpanzer T-34. </p>
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Finnish also used many T-34 either captured from the Soviets or purchased from Germany's captured stocks, 
                              they remained in service until 1968. </p>

                            client-states. And participate to numerous wars such the Korean War, the Angolan Civil War, Yugoslav Wars, etc.
                            Some are still in service in the 21st Century in several developing or third-world countries. Soviet Union eventually

                         <p class="bodyTextT">The State Defense Committee met on August 25, 1943, following the battle of Kursk, 
                           and decided to upgrade the T-34 with a new gun. The T-43 was dropped in order to not have to completely 
                           retool the production lines relocated at such great price to the foothills of the Ural mountains. But at 
                           the same time, this posed a real challenge to the engineers, whom had to conceive a new turret capable of 
                           housing the long barreled 52K model 39, the standard anti-aircraft gun of the Red Army at the time, without 
                           touching the lower part of the tank, chassis, transmission, suspension or engine. Choosing this gun was a bold 
                           move, clearly influenced by the heavy toll imposed by the German 88 mm (3.46 in) on every front since the beginning 
                           of the war. In the endless race between firepower and protection, it became apparent that no engine of the time 
                           could give a tank, with sufficient protection from the German 88 mm (3.46 in), the minimal mobility requirements
                           put up by the Red Army. The original T-34/76 seemed to have the perfect balance of speed, armor and firepower 
                           at first, but since by 1943 its firepower was limited and something had to be changed, protection was sacrificed.
                           On the other hand, keeping the T-34 virtually unchanged except the turret could provide the assurance of a 
                           quick transition, almost uninterrupted, between the two types, which was just what the Stavka required to 
                           keep the edge in terms of numbers.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">The T-34 was a Soviet medium tank designed to be the successor of cavalry tanks like the BT 
                            series or the T-26. It became the mainstay of the Red Army's Armored divisions.</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">The program to replace the T-26 and BT tanks series was born in 1937, with Mikhail Koshkin 
                            comes with its first protoype the "A-20", armed with a 45mm gun it borrowed its predecessor's convertible drive 
                            system, a new Diesel engine and sloped armor. After the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939, where Soviets fast tanks 
                            showed their limits as their armor thickness, rivets and petrol engines tends make them easy prey for Japanese Ha-Gos 
                            and IJA tank-killer teams with Cocktail Molotov, Koshkin convinced Stalin to authorize further development and the "A-32" 
                            protoype was developed with its thicker armor, Christie suspension and a 76.2mm gun. During tests at Kubinka, despite the 
                            increased armor it kept the same mobility as its forerunner so it was favored over the A-20. In 1940 they increased its armor 
                            even more, fitting with wider tracks and a new 76.2m L-11 gun, the new "T-34 Model 1940" was born. With about 400 models of 
                            this variant were made the production quickly switched to the "Model 1941" equipped with the new 76.2mm F-34 gun and new radios. 
                            In 1942 appeared the "Model 1942" that featured thicker armor protection and minor manufacturing improvements such as new tracks, 
                            wheel patterns or driver hatch. The "Model 1943" make its appearance in May 1942 featured a new hexagonal turret (cast or pressed 
                            depending on the factories), a little more armour, more storage for ammunition and more fuel. </p>
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">After improved German Panzer IVs with the high-velocity 75 mm (2.95 in) gun were encountered in combat in 1942,
                              a project to design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, with the goals of increasing armour protection while adding modern 
                              features like a torsion-bar suspension and a three-man turret. This new tank, the <a class="text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-43_medium_tank" target="_blank">T-43</a>, was intended to be a universal tank 
                              to replace both the T-34 and the KV-1 heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype's armour, though heavier, was still not proof 
                              against German 88 mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 
                              70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant slow-down in production.
                              Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.</p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Not only were the weapons of German tanks improving, so was their armour. Soviet firing tests against a captured Tiger I heavy tank 
                              in April 1943 showed that the T-34's 76 mm gun could not penetrate the front of the Tiger I at all, 
                              and the side only at the very close range. A Soviet 85 mm anti-aircraft gun, the 52-K, was found 
                              capable of doing the job, and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks. The resulting tank gun could 
                              penetrate the side armour of the Tiger I from a distance of 800 meters and the turret side from a distance 
                              of 600 meters. It was still not enough to match the Tiger, as a Tiger could destroy the T-34 from a distance of 1,500 to 2,000 
                              meters, but it was a noticeable improvement. </p>
                              
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">With the T-43 canceled, the Soviet command made the decision to retool the factories to produce an improved 
                             version of the T-34. Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425 mm (56 in) to 1,600 mm (63 in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted 
                             and thus the larger 85 mm gun. The prototype T-43's turret design was hurriedly adopted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the Krasnoye Sormovo 
                             Factory to fit the T-34. This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. 
                             Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and the loader. 
                             The turret armour was much thicker, 90 mm, even if bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret. This made the turret, overall, a bigger target 
                             (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but more resistant to enemy fire. The ammunition load shrank from around 90-100 to 55-60 shells, but
                             the projectiles were 50% heavier (9 kg) and were much better in the anti-armour role, and reasonable in a general purpose role. The resulting new tank, 
                             the T-34-85, was seen as a compromise between advocates for the T-43 and others who wanted to continue to build as many 76 mm-armed T-34s as possible without interruption.</p>

                           <p class="bodyTextT">Production of the T-34-85 began in January 1944 at Factory No. 112, first using the D-5T 85 mm gun. 
                             Parallel to the production of the T-34-85 with the D-5T gun, production of the T-34-85 using the S-53 gun 
                             (later to be modified and redesignated as the ZIS-S-53 gun) began in February 1944 at Factory No. 112.
                             The improved T-34-85 became the standard Soviet medium tank, with an uninterrupted production run until the end of the war. 
                             A T-34-85 initially cost about 30 percent more to produce than a Model 1943, at 164,000 rubles; by 1945 this had been reduced to 142,000 rubles. 
                             During the course of the World War II, the cost of a T-34 tank was reduced by almost half, from 270,000 rubles in 1941, while in the meantime 
                             its top speed remained about the same, and its main gun's armour penetration and turret frontal armour thickness both nearly doubled.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">The T-34-85 gave the Red Army a tank with better armour and mobility than the German Panzer IV tank and StuG III assault gun. 
                            While it could not match the armour or weapons of the heavier Panther and Tiger tanks, its improved firepower made it much more effective than earlier 
                            models, and overall it was more cost-effective than the heaviest German tanks. In comparison with the T-34-85 program, the Germans instead chose an 
                            upgrade path based on the introduction of completely new, expensive, heavier, and more complex tanks, greatly slowing the growth of their tank 
                            production and aiding the Soviets in maintaining a substantial numerical superiority in tanks.[105] By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 
                            1,200 tanks per month. In the entire war, production figures for all Panther types reached no more than 6,557, and for all Tiger types 
                            (including the Tiger I and Tiger II) 2,027. Production figures for the T-34-85 alone reached 22,559.</p>

                           defence commissar and politician Kliment Voroshilov, operated with the Red Army during World War II. The KV 
                           tanks were known for their heavy armour protection during the early stages of the war, especially during the 
                           first year of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In certain situations, even a single KV-1 or KV-2 supported 
                           by infantry could halt large German formations. The German Wehrmacht at that time rarely deployed its tanks 
                           against KVs, as their own armament was too poor to deal with the "Russischer Koloss" – "Russian Colossus".</p>

                            7.5 cm KwK 37 guns mounted, respectively, on the early Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks fielded by 
                            the invading German forces. Until the Germans developed more effective guns, the KV-1 was invulnerable 
                            to almost any German weapon except the 8.8 cm Flak gun.</p>

                            then in Soviet service were of the KV-1 type. As the war progressed, it became evident that there was little
                            sense in producing the expensive KV tanks, as the T-34 medium tank performed better (or at least equally well) 
                            in all practical respects. In fact the only advantage the KV had over the T-34/76 was its larger and roomier 
                            three-man turret. Later in the war, the KV series became a base for the development of the IS (Iosif Stalin) 
                            series of tanks and self-propelled guns. </p>

                              Soviet tank designers started drawing up replacements. The T-35 conformed to the 1920s 
                              notion of a "breakthrough tank" with very heavy firepower and armour protection, but suffered from poor mobility. 
                              The Spanish Civil War demonstrated the need for much heavier armour on tanks, and was the main 
                              influence on Soviet tank design just prior to World War II.Several competing designs were offered, and even 
                              more were drawn up prior to reaching prototype stage. All had heavy armour, torsion-bar suspension, wide tracks, 
                              and were of welded and cast construction. One of the main competing designs was the SMK, which in its final form 
                              had two turrets, mounting one 76.2 mm and one 45 mm weapon. The designers of the SMK independently drew up a 
                              single-turreted variant and this received approval at the highest level. Two of these, named after the People's 
                              Defence Commissioner, were ordered alongside a single SMK. The smaller hull and single turret enabled the designer 
                              to install heavy frontal and turret armour while keeping the weight within manageable limits. </p>

                           <p class="bodyTextT">The KV was ordered right off the drawing board. When the Soviets entered the Winter War, 
                             the SMK, KV and a third design, the T-100, were sent to be tested in combat conditions. The KV outperformed the SMK and 
                             T-100 designs. The KV's heavy armour proved highly resistant to Finnish anti-tank weapons, making it more difficult to 
                             stop. In 1939, the production of 50 KVs was ordered. During the war, the Soviets found it difficult to deal with the 
                             concrete bunkers used by the Finns and a request was made for a tank with a large howitzer. One of the rush projects 
                             to meet the request put the howitzer in a new turret on one of the KV tanks. Initially known as 'Little turret KV' 
                             and 'Big turret KV', the 76-mm-armed tank was redesignated as the <b>KV-1 Heavy Tank</b> and the 152 mm howitzer one as

                                attacking a column of German trucks. The tank stopped on a road across soft ground and was engaged by four 50 mm anti-tank guns of the 
                                6th Panzer Division's anti-tank battalion. The tank was hit multiple times by it but fired back, disabling all four guns. 
                                A heavy 88 mm gun of the German division's anti-aircraft battalion was moved about 730 metres (800 yd) behind the tank, 
                                but was knocked out by the tank before it could score a hit. During the night, German combat engineers attempted to destroy 
                                the tank with satchel charges, but were unable to, despite possibly damaging the tracks. Early on the morning of 25 June, 
                                German tanks fired on the KV from the woodland while an 88 mm targeted the tank from its rear. Of several shots fired, only 
                                two penetrated the tank. German infantry then advanced, with the KV opening machine-gun fire against them. The tank's 
                                resistance was finally ended by grenades thrown into the tank's hatches. According to some accounts, the crew was buried 
                                by the German soldiers with full military honours; in other accounts, the crew escaped during the night.</p>

                            take part to the last German major offensive during the Battle of Kursk in July. However in late 1942 and July 1943 the T-34 saw two

                            the 76.2mm gun and able to destroy the T-34 far outside its effective range. In summer 1943 the T-34 was judged outmatched by new German 
                            tanks, its evolution the T-34-85 was produced from January 1944 to the end of war. While its new 85mm was still not enough to match the 
                            Tiger it was a major improvement and it participate to all major Soviets offensive until the Battle of Berlin. The T-34 also saw limited

                            It was accepted for production and designated the KV-2. First trials were conducted on 10th February,
                            1940 and shortly after, two prototypes were sent to the front on the Karelian Isthmus. However, 
                            there is some debate as to whether these prototypes saw combat. Recent evidence suggests that

                            positions and pillboxes referred to tests conducted against already captured positions.</p>
                             
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT"><b>Variants:</b> Designation of two models varies between sources and can be confusing. The earlier 
                              model of the KV-2 had a turret with a sloped front with rivets and only featured one DT machine gun in a 
                              hull mount. It weighed 53.8 tons, and was the lesser produced model. In German sources, this variant is 
                              referred to as the KW-II.  This model is sometimes erroneously called the KV-2 M1939 or KV-2 M1940. The 
                              turret is often wrongly called the MT-1, but that is the designation of the gun mount, not the turret. 
                              Sometimes the MT-10 designation is also wrongly used for the turret, and this seems like a mix of 
                              the mount name and the gun name (MT-1 + M-10). The turret was actually simply called “big turret” (большой башней).</p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">The later variant of the KV-2 featured the more common and boxy turret, featuring a 
                              second DT machine gun in a rear mount, and an improved rear turret hatch that made resupplying ammunition 
                              easier. The armor was kept the same, but thanks to the removal of the angled turret front, it had a much 
                              roomier crew turret, meaning that working conditions were better for the crew, especially the loaders. 
                              In German sources, this variant is referred to as the KW-2B or KW-IIB. It is sometimes wrongly designated 
                              as the KV-2A, KV-2 M1940, KV-2 M1941 or KV-2B. The turret is often erroneously called the MT-2, seemingly 
                              as a progression over the wrong MT-1 designation of the previous turret. The turret was also simply 
                              called “reduced turret” (пониженная башня).</p>

                             tests before they were fitted with a new commander’s cupola and sent back to the front line. These were 
                             designated (Sturm)Panzerkampfwagen KV-II 754(r) and were often used for artillery observation due to 
                             their height.</p>.

                              <p class="bodyTextT">Due to its size and armored strength, it was nicknamed “Dreadnought” by its six man crews. 
                                The KV-2 first saw service in the Winter War as a prototype, as did many other vehicles. However, they were 
                                too late to test their might against the more fortified Finnish defenses, as they had already been overrun. 
                                Despite this, they still destroyed some remaining enemy bunkers and AT guns. Finnish AT guns were ill-prepared 
                                for the KV-2’s strong armor, and even reportedly stopped firing after three non-penetrations.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">In the opening years of WWII, when the KV-2 operated in vast numbers, it was virtually invulnerable to direct 
                            fire from all but high velocity weapons at horrifically close-range. The best the enemy could hope to was force the KV-2’s crew 
                            to abandon the vehicle by disabling it, such as by hitting its tracks and wheels, but this did not always go to plan. A clear 
                            example of this was in June 1941, near Raseiniai. Roughly 20 KV tanks of the Soviet 3rd Mechanized Corps met the assault of 
                            the 6th Panzer Division, with approximately 100 vehicles. Another vehicle, probably a KV-2 tank, managed to hold off the 
                            German advance for a full day while being pummeled by a variety of antitank weapons, until finally the tank ran out of 
                            ammunition and was finally knocked out.</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">Having said this, the KV-2 paid a high price for its immense gun and vast armor. Its mobility between
                            engagements and during battle was heavily restricted by many of the initial gear and transmission problems that the 
                            KV-1 faced. This situation was made even worse by the fact that the vehicle now weighed 53.8-57.9 tonnes 
                            depending on the model, as well as by using the unimproved 500 bhp V-2 diesel engine.</p>
                              
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">The road speed of a KV-2 was no more than 25 km/h (15.5 mph) and it only reached a mere 12 km/h 
                              (7.5 mph) off-road, making it a very slow moving vehicle. It was also prone to having trouble traversing the heavy 
                              turret if not on relatively flat ground. These problems all limited the flexibility of the KV-2 combat, 
                              but nevertheless, it was still a formidable opponent if dug into a strategic position. However, it lacked 
                              speed and mobility – two traits shown to be massively important in the opening years of the war.</p>
                                
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">The worst problem for the KV-2 was by far its unreliability. The gearbox would often break easily, 
                             and the immense recoil of the gun meant that the small turret ring could jam, or the engine or gearbox could suffer 
                             severe damage. The majority of KV-2 losses in 1941 were due to breakdowns or lack of fuel which forced them to be 
                             abandoned. The 41st Tank Division lost two thirds of its 33 KV-2s, but only five were as a result of enemy 
                             action – usually landmines, as there were few insufficient AT guns or enemy tanks capable of knocking out 
                             a KV-2, and as it was used as a breakthrough tank, the KV-2 would often be the first victim of mines.</p>
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Despite this, KV tanks came as a nasty shock to German invaders due to their resilience. 
                              They had no comparable tanks in strength, and few AT guns that could destroy them. Marshal Rokossovsky later recalled 
                              in his memoirs, A Soldier’s Duty:<br>
                              <i>“They withstood the fire of every type of gun that the German tanks were armed with. But what a sight they were 
                              returning from combat. Their armor all pock-marked all over and sometimes even their barrels were pierced.”</i></p>
                              
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Similarly, the experience of the 1st Panzer Division on 23rd June, 1941 in Lithuania 
                              proves just how resilient the KV-2 could be. Here is a record of the engagement:<br>
                              <i>“Our companies opened fire from 700 m (765 yd). We got closer and closer… Soon we were only about 50-100 m (55-110 yd) 
                              from each other. A fantastic engagement opened up – without any German progress. The Soviet tanks continued their advance 
                              and our armor-piercing projectiles simply bounced off. The Soviet tanks withstood point-blank 
                              fire from both our 50 mm (1.97 in) and 75 mm (2.95 in) guns. A KV-2 was hit more than 70 times and not a single round penetrated. 
                              A very few Soviet tanks were immobilized and eventually destroyed as we managed to shoot at their tracks, and then brought up artillery 
                              to hammer them at close range. It was then attacked at close range with satchel charges.”</i></p>

                         <p class="bodyTextT">The IS-2, named after Soviet leader <b>Joseph Stalin (JS) / Iosif Stalin</b> (IS, in Cyrillic <b>Ио́сиф Ста́лин "ИС"</b>) was a 
                           Soviet heavy tank, the successor of the IS-1. One of the most powerful tanks of World War II, it was heavily 
                           armed with a long-barreled 122 mm gun and well-sloped thick armor</p>       
                              
                              
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">As the escalation between German and Russian engineers reached a new point with the introduction on the German side of the Panther 
                              and Tiger, and the knowledge that something bigger was brewing, the IS-2 was pressed into introduction as soon as its main armament 
                              was ready. With a partly sloped frontal armor, 120 mm (4.72 in) thick and, moreover, a new massive 122 mm (4.8 in) main gun, the new 
                              heavy tank seemed to be just the trump card Stalin needed to wash over any armored opposition on the Eastern Front. Or so it seemed 
                              on paper. In reality, some shortcuts were taken to meet the expectations. These would prove real issues on the long run, starting 
                              with the gun itself, slow to reload and with bulky two-piece naval ammunition.</p>
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">In 1943, IS-2 was developed to replace the KV-1, because it was completely obsolete with its poor mobility and 
                            weaponry to deal with new German tanks such as the Tiger I. The heavy tank project started gradually, from light and fast heavy 
                            KV-1S, average and decent heavy KV-85, the first phase of the IS heavy tank, the IS-85/IS-1, to the most successful 
                            phase, the IS-122/IS-2 Model 1943 and IS-2 Model 1944. </p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">The IS-2 Model 1943 immediately entered into service in April 1944. It was armed with a 122 mm A-19 Gun for both anti-tank
                            and anti-infantry purposes. The frontal armor scheme of this model was stepped 120 mm frontal armor plates, this broken nose design 
                            had been transferred over from its predecessor the IS-1.</p>
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">The 122 mm A-19 Gun was developed into the purpose designed with a 122 mm D-25T gun, with better fire control and improved 
                              performance against enemy armor, such as the Panther. The stepped 120 mm frontal armor plates were replaced by a single sloped 90 or 100 mm 
                              frontal armor plate, increasing the armor effectiveness drastically, despite a reduction in thickness. It had the capability to withstand 
                              most enemy ordinance including in some cases the PaK43 L/71. </p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">IS-2 was a very effective heavy breakthrough tank, largely due to its impressive 122 mm gun and well-sloped armor. 
                              Its gun was primarily designed for infantry support, in particular as a 'bunker buster' however the gun quickly showed excellent performance 
                              against enemy armor due to the high caliber gun that could maximize the effectiveness of both armor-piercing ballistic capped (APBC) 
                              shell and high-explosive (HE) shell. Amazing over 3 days in July 1944 a regiment of IS -2s destroyed 23 Tigers and Panthers for the 
                              loss of 11 vehicles. It could destroy most of the heavily armored tanks with just a direct hit from an APBC shell. It was also 
                              well-suited to take out enemy infantry and fortifications by utilizing HE shells.</p>

                                perhaps 50% being of the new IS-2 1944 model. There was a subtle difference concerning the nose, between the one manufactured 
                                by Chelyabinsk (rounded cast) in August 1944, and the UZTM nose which had a flat lower bow plate. But as soon as they were put 
                                into service, alarming reports claimed that the limited ammo provision always meant supply had to be carried by following trucks, 
                                and the low rate of fire was almost half that of the T-34/85, while the latter had greater muzzle velocity.</p>

                           <p class="bodyTextT">The IS-2 tank first saw combat in early 1944, equipping elite Guards Heavy Tank Regiments 
                             of the Red Army. First encountered by Otto Carius and a fellow Tiger I. After knocking out a column of T-34's,
                             Carius moved into a nearby village where he came face to face with the new IS-2. It was quickly destroyed, 
                             however as Carius moved further into the village he discovered a platoon of eight IS-2s. Carius and the 2nd 
                             Tiger dispatched all eight tanks without a loss. This was due to the fact that in order to reload the 
                             IS’s 122mm canon, the barrel had to be lowered to allow a new shell to be inserted into the breach. A 
                             regiment had 21 IS-2 tanks in four companies of five tanks each and one being used by the regimental commander.
                             The special tank regiments were reserved for important attacks, often to spearhead attempts to break through fortified 
                             German positions like anti-tank defence lines and bunkers. The tanks supporting infantry in the assault by destroying
                             bunkers, buildings, dug-in weapons and engaging German armoured vehicles. Once a breakthrough was achieved, lighter 
                             and more mobile tanks were used for exploitation and mopping-up. The IS-2 tank first saw action in Ukraine in early 
                             1944 and claimed to have destroyed more than forty Tigers and Elefants for the loss of only eight tanks. While 
                             the German heavy tanks could knock out the IS-2, they had no real answer to its 122 mm gun, which easily outgunned them.</p>

                         <p class="bodyTextT">The ISU-152 was an absolute nightmare for the Wehrmacht. Much like the SU-152, it was capable of 
                           blowing Tiger, Ferdinand, and Panther turrets/casemates open. However, what made the ISU-152 inherently better 
                           than the SU-152 was its superior armor and towing power. It had three major roles – assault gun, tank destroyer 
                           and mobile artillery, which made it one of the most versatile heavy vehicles of the war. After the war, it remained 
                           in service well until the 1970s, and some even saw some unconventional action at the Chernobyl liquidation, 1986.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">The ISU-152 came about for two main reasons – the success of the SU-152, and the arrival of the IS 
                            heavy tank hull. Seeing as though the IS was an upgrade of the KV series, which the SU-152 was based on, it made 
                            perfect sense to mount the same weapons on the newer platform. This would mean that maintenance would be easier, 
                            with a sort-of standardization of late war tanks. Shortly after the SU-152’s deployment, the NKTP (Ministry of 
                            Transport Machine-Building Industry) ordered design teams in Chelyabinsk, in cooperation with the Mechanized 
                            Artillery Bureau, and General F. Petrov, to design two new heavy assault guns based on the IS-2 hull on May 
                            25th, 1943. The development for this tank was undertaken by the famous Joseph Kotin, and G.N. Moskvin as 
                            the main designer – the first prototype was ready in only a month.</p>

                            <p class="bodyTextT">The first prototype, known as the IS-152, was similar to the SU-152, except for a higher superstructure 
                              that was more rectangular, and also featured less sloped side armor. Thicker frontal and side armor (90 mm instead of 60 mm)
                              did not make the crew compartment any smaller, so there was still space for 20 shells for the ML-20S gun.
                              The other main differences between the SU-152 and the IS-152 were that the suspension was lower, 
                              and a heavy, two-piece gun mantlet was bolted onto the right of the hull. It underwent factory
                              trials in September, 1943, but a large number of problems with the design was encountered, so the design was reworked.</p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">The ISU-152 was hardly a different concept to other Soviet self-propelled guns. It still featured two 
                              compartments – the fighting compartment and ammo storage in the front, and engine and transmission at the back. The gun was 
                              mounted slightly off-center and could traverse 12 degrees left and right. It had 12 torsion bars, 6 road wheels, rear drive
                              sprockets, and front idlers identical to road wheels, thus making maintenance easier. There were three internal fuel tanks
                              – one in the rear compartment, and two in the fighting compartment. Like most late-war Soviet tanks, there were also up to
                              four external fuel tanks that were not connected to the engine.</p>
                              
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">The biggest let down for the ISU-152 was its ammunition capacity. It only had space for 20 shells, usually 
                             13 HE and 7 AP or Concrete-Piercing, and possibly some stowed on the rear deck. It took up to 40 minutes to resupply ammunition
                             and it needed a very strong loader, as each shell weighed over 40 kg. This would strongly affect combat capabilities, especially
                             if supply lines were bogged down, or if an offensive lasted too long, meaning that the tank would run out of munitions
                             far too quickly. Having said this, an experienced crew would make the best use of its limited ammunition and it would fare well.</p>
                            
                            
                            
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Most ISU-152 were often fielded in mixed units with the ISU-122, despite attempts by Red Army Commanders to segregate the two vehicles. 
                            There were two main reasons for this – the first being that two sets of calculations would be needed for indirect fire orders, and 
                            the second being that the tanks took different ammunition types, which would cause supply problems, as two sets of ammunition would 
                            need transporting.</p>

                           <p class="bodyTextT">The ISU-152 was in various roles near the end of the war. As a heavy assault gun in urban combat operations, using it 
                             front armor as a protection to advance under German AT guns, such as Budapest, Königsberg or Berlin. As a tank destroyer as 
                             its gun was able to destroy nearly all german tanks and its protection that negated the Tiger's long range superiority and 
                             forcing it to close or medium range. And then as heavy self-propelled artillery, providing better protection compared to 
                             towed artillery but suffered of a very limited ammunition storage that needed to be replenished every 40 minutes and 
                             required a very strong loader. </p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT"><b>Tank Destroyer Role:</b> Whilst not designed for this role, it inherited the name “Zveroboy” (Beast killer)
                            from the SU-152, because it could knock out the Panther, Tiger, and King Tiger tanks, as well as the Jagdtiger, and
                            Ferdinand/Elefant. It is actually well known for this role because the Soviets were able to make this into a very
                            effective propaganda tool in the late war. Whilst the weight of the shells (and therefore slow loading) resulted
                            in 1-3 rounds per minute, the sheer mechanical shock was enough to kill the crew of an enemy tank, or disable
                            an enemy tank even without an armor penetration, which is useful because generally, these shells did not penetrate.
                            It has even been reported that the shell could totally blow the turret off of a Tiger tank!</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT"><b>Self-propelled Artillery Role: </b>When field guns were in short supply, the ISU-152 was able to 
                            perform preparatory shelling to help out with Red Army advances. The Soviets never had any specialized, mass-produced 
                            vehicle for this purpose, but the ISU-152 was as close as they would get for the time being. Whilst towed artillery 
                            units were given to mechanized divisions, they were vulnerable and slow to field compared to the ISU-152. However, 
                            it must be remembered that in heavy SPG regiments, the tactics used for the ISU tanks were not indirect fire, 
                            but direct fire, making this role a rarity.</p>
                              
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT"><b>Assault Gun Role: </b>Assault gun was the main role taken on by the ISU-152. It was 
                              described as one of the most valuable weapons in urban areas like Budapest, Berlin, and Konigsberg. 
                              Its armor was, as mentioned, surprisingly excellent defense against German AT guns. The massive HE 
                              shells were perfect for taking out enemy fortified positions and buildings. Considering that using 
                              the conventional, towed ML-20 field gun would result in its crew being exposed, mounting the same 
                              gun in a tank negated that problem, and proved to have fantastic results. When supporting other 
                              tanks, the ISU-152 was always placed behind an IS, about 100-200 m behind, and it was usually 
                              second in the column.</p>

                         <p class="bodyTextT">The BA-64, the standard light armored car of the Red Army, was first envisioned between 
                           July and December 1941 on the chassis of the GAZ-64 car. It used both pre-war Soviet developments in 
                           all-wheel drive armored cars and the experience gained in the study of captured German armored vehicles, like 
                           the <a class="text" href="http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/sdkfz-221-222-223.php" target="_blank">Sd.Kfz.222</a> . The BA-64 was the first Soviet all-wheel drive armored car and would remain the only 
                           vehicle of this class in service during the war, with a production of up to 9110 armored vehicles from 
                           April 1942 to early 1946.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">Before the summer of 1941, the only light armored car in service with the Red Army was the BA-20M,
                            based on the GAZ-M-1. It had a rear-wheel drive chassis, unable to provide off-road capabilities and having weak armor,
                            barely capable of resisting machine-gun fire. However, the personal vehicle GAZ-64 was just entering service in 1941
                            and used all-wheel drive, well adapted for bad terrain.</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">It was decided to replace the BA-20 with a new armored vehicle based on the GAZ-64 using sloped armor, 
                            already tested for small vehicles. On July 17, 1941, the GAZ Design Bureau, under the direction of A. Grachev, 
                            began work on the future BA-64. At first it was planned to use the maximum amount of parts from the BA-20, but it 
                            quickly appeared that the new hull required new solutions. Before the war started, Sd.Kfz.221s and 222s were tested 
                            at the German-Soviet testing ground, the landfills at the Institute of Kuban.</p>
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Russian engineers were already familiar with their hull shapes. One was transferred to GAZ for a detailed 
                              study. A meeting was held at GAZ in September 1940 to discuss the new model, then called 64-B, and chief designer A. 
                              Liphart defined a minimalist vehicle with a sloped hull only slightly protruding the frame chassis. All internal components 
                              had to be redrawn to fit inside the cramped, sloped hull and all measures of ultra-rationalization of the internal 
                              space applied.</p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">Development at GAZ-125 was performed by armored body specialists – BT Komarevsky, VF Samoilov, N. Sorochkin, 
                              G. Nosov, as well as the designer of OKB AS, who dealt with the design of the turret and NA Astrov as consultant in 
                              exercise works. By 15 October, the first and second options for the internal layout were ready, after which the team 
                              started to work under the direction of chief designer GM Wasserman. Despite the lack of experience of most designers, 
                              it progressed rapidly. By November 24-27, the body armor was ready, demonstrated before Marshal Voroshilov, who supervised the project.</p>
                              
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">Final prototype’s “64-125” assembly was finished on January 9, 1942, and made its first trip, showing excellent c
                             haracteristics, save for a weakness of the suspensions. By February 17, the BA-64 was shown to the Commissar for Tank 
                             Industry VA Malyshev in Moscow. Then it was finally approved as BA-64 and, between February 21-23, weapon tests were 
                             conducted at the Sofrinsky artillery range and the range of Plant Number 8. On March 3, along with the new light tank 
                             T-70, it was again demonstrated at the Kremlin before members of the government, including Stalin himself. After all 
                             the necessary improvements, the BA-64 was accepted for service on the 14th of March. Grachev was awarded the Stalin 
                             Prize of the third degree in April, for the development of the GAZ-64 and the BA-64 on its basis.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p class="bodyTextT">The body was assembled by welding sheets of rolled steel armor ranging from 4 to 12 mm (0.16-0.47 in) (early) or to 
                              15 mm (0.59 in) (late). The hull had a hexagonal cross-section, all surfaces being placed at an angle of at least 30°. The frontal part 
                              was 12-15 mm (0.47-0.59 in) thick at 40°, the two lower front plates were 9 mm (0.35 in) at 30° and 52° angles. On later production 
                              models the two lower sheets has been replaced by a single, obliquely arranged at 32°. The bottom front of the chassis was used as 
                              air intake for the engine, and had 6 mm (0.24 in) armored shutters. The lower part of the body was made of boards placed at an 
                              angle of 30°, 9 mm (0.35 in) thick. The upper side plates were at 30°, 6 mm (0.24 in) thick for the engine compartment 
                              and 9 mm (0.35 in) for the driver’s and crew compartment. The floor and roof were 4 and 6 mm (0.16-0.24 in) thick.</p>
                              
                           
                       
                
                
                            <p class="bodyTextT">The level of protection was ideal against small arms fire from any distance. 12.7 mm (0.5 in) conventional 
                              bullets were deviated on the upper frontal sheet at all distances, while the rest of the armor was efficient only at distances
                              of more than 500 m (547 yd). Armor-piercing 12.7 mm (0.5 in) bullets were only stopped by the upper frontal plate at distances
                              of more than 800 m (875 yd). Access for the crew was ensured by two hatches in the lower part of the fighting compartment and 
                              the commander had his own access point on top of the turret.</p>

                           <p class="bodyTextT">Production of the BA-64 fully commenced at the GAZ factory plant in April 1942, and a 
                             first batch of 35 was delivered the same month, but not accepted by the military because of the lack of bullet-proof tires. 
                             They were taken in service anyway in early May with standard tires. Delays occurred in the supply of components, especially 
                             engines, axles and tires, but in July 1942 the plant had reached its objectives. First changes came with the first operational 
                             experiences.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">Operations also identified a general lack of reliability. Despite a guaranteed mileage of 10,000 km (6213 mi), 
                            according to reports, many BA-64s broke down already at 1000-4000 km (621-2485 mi). The main reason was rear axle failure. 
                            This was caused by overloading that occurred in the majority of cases as a result of improper handling and increasing torque 
                            abnormally to the rear axle. By November, a non-disconnectable front axle was introduced and the conversion of many BA-64s was 
                            carried out by local military workshops. By February, the revised design introduced a number of changes aimed at strengthening 
                            the semi-axles and bridges, and later an additional pair of hydraulic shock absorbers and reinforced springs. Peripheral 
                            vision was also enhanced.</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">The BA-64 was widely used by Soviet troops from the summer of 1942 until the end of the war, mainly as a 
                            reconnaissance vehicle and also in direct support of the infantry. In the postwar years, the BA-64 was mainly used as a 
                            training and combat vehicle and withdrawn from active service during the first half of 1950. The BA-64 was also delivered 
                            in numbers to Soviet Union allies and used in the Korean War. Its deficiencies were clearly shown. Early unreliability, poor 
                            horizontal stability, lack of firepower, cramped and hot interior. Despite of this, it remained popular due to its speed and 
                            the relatively good protection of nearly 15 mm (0.59 in) of sloped armor, giving an equivalent of 20-22 mm (0.79-0.87 in).</p>

                         <p class="bodyTextT">The Kiev-class aircraft carriers, Soviet designation Project 1143 Krechyet (gyrfalcon), 
                           was the first class of fixed-wing aircraft carriers (heavy aircraft cruiser in Soviet classification) built in the Soviet 
                           Union for the Soviet Navy.</p>          
                                
                                
                                
                          <p class="bodyTextT">First laid down in 1970, the Kiev class was partially based on a design for a full-deck carrier proposed in Project Orel. 
                            Originally the Soviet Navy wanted a supercarrier similar to the American Kitty Hawk-class. However, the smaller Kiev-class 
                            design was chosen because it was considered to be more cost effective.</p>
                                
                    
                              
                          <p class="bodyTextT">Unlike most NATO aircraft carriers, such as U.S. or British ones, the Kiev class is a combination of both a cruiser 
                            and an aircraft carrier. In the Soviet Navy, this class of ships was specifically designated as a "heavy aviation cruiser" 
                            (Russian: Тяжелые авианесущие крейсера) rather than solely an aircraft carrier. This designation allowed the ships to transit 
                            the Turkish Straits, while the Montreux Convention prohibited aircraft carriers heavier than 15,000 tons from passing through the Straits. </p>
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">The ships were designed with a large island superstructure to starboard, with an angled flight deck 2/3rds of the 
                              length of the total deck, and the foredeck was taken up with heavy surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missile armament. 
                              The intended mission of the Kiev class was support for strategic missile submarines, other surface ships and naval aviation; 
                              it was capable of engaging in anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, and surface warfare.</p>
                                
                              
                              
                            <p class="bodyTextT">A total of <b>four</b> Kiev-class carriers were built and commissioned, serving in the Soviet and then Russian Navy. 
                              The first two ships were sold to China as museums, and the third ship was scrapped. The fourth ship, Admiral Gorshkov, 
                              was sold to the Indian Navy in 2004, and after years of extensive modifications and refurbishment, is currently in 
                              active service as INS Vikramaditya.</p>
                              
                              
                           <p class="bodyTextT">Unlike American aircraft carriers, these Soviet ships are not pure cruisers, nor are they authentic aircraft carriers, 
                             but hybrids. Aircraft require, their flight deck is differentiated from the Moskva by being lateral, the superstructure spreading along its length.
                             The entire front of the hull, on the other hand, is that of a cruiser, with a complete panoply to meet all needs: long-range antiswile missiles,
                             medium and short range antiaircraft, torpedo tubes, AA and AM guns, and 3 rocket launchers ASM, with 31 additional devices including
                             12 Yak and 18/19 Kamov “Hormone”. The latter can deploy light anti-ship missiles and tactical nuclear ASM grenades against ANS.</p>
                          
                          
                          
                           <p class="bodyTextT">These impressive buildings, however, were handicapped by too low a load of poor quality interceptors. 
                             The Yak-38 “Forger” (NATO code), were in the opinion of all the experts, and the Soviets themselves (the pilots among others), 
                             the pale copies of the British Harriers, devoid of surface radar, slow, unmanageable, with a very limited load bearing, low range, 
                             and controllable nozzle operation controversial: There were probably accidents never officially revealed, but the “Forger” 
                             quickly gained a reputation for flying dangerous. In 1991, the two remaining in service were simply scrapped. Their replacements, 
                             the Yak-141 “Freehand”, supersonic and with better characteristics were then phase of tests when the Soviet Union knew its budgetary cuts budget. 
                             The Yak 141 was never operational and sank into oblivion.</p>
